# Sassafras
Aliases for Discord

## Please Note: 
Due to gateway changes, this program no longer works and due to [Discord's new view on selfbots](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-user-accounts-self-bots-) will not be updated unless these rules change. Thank you for your understanding.

# How does it work?
Once you begin hosting Sassafras, typing an allias anywhere in a message will have it replaced by the translation phrase.
This will happen no matter where you do it, other computers, desktops, laptops, even on mobile!
A video demonstration can be seen [here](https://qanazoga.com/files/sassafras-example.webm).

## How to use the Alias File
The alias file is simple json, so it's easy for anyone to edit and understand with ease.
```json
{
  ";;ping": "pong",
  ";;rules": "rule 1: Don't talk about fight club. rule 2: DON'T TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUB"
}
```
